Hereâ€™s a sequenced DevOps learning roadmap, structured by priority and complexity, assuming you're aiming for a mid-senior level DevOps role.
âœ… PHASE 1: Foundation Expansion (Immediate Next Steps)

These are critical topics that build on your current strengths.

        Git branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based)

    CI/CD Fundamentals

        Understand CI/CD principles

        Learn tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI

        Pipelines: build, test, deploy stages

        Artifacts, caching, rollback mechanisms

    Intermediate AWS Services

        IAM (roles, policies, STS)

        EC2, S3, RDS

        VPC, Security Groups, NACLs

        CloudWatch & CloudTrail

        Auto Scaling, Load Balancers

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

        Learn Terraform deeply (preferred in the industry)

        Basics of CloudFormation (optional but good to know)

        State management, modules, workspaces, remote backend

âœ… PHASE 2: Containers & Orchestration

This is the core of modern DevOps work. Must-have knowledge for 5+ year roles.

    Docker

        Writing and optimizing Dockerfiles

        Volumes, networking, multi-stage builds

        Docker Compose

    Kubernetes (K8s)

        Architecture: pods, deployments, services, config maps, secrets

        Helm (templating and chart management)

        Minikube, kubeadm, or EKS (AWS managed K8s)

        Monitoring, logging inside K8s clusters

        Ingress controllers (Nginx, Traefik)

        RBAC, namespaces, resource limits

âœ… PHASE 3: Monitoring, Observability & Logging

    Monitoring & Alerting

        Prometheus + Grafana

        CloudWatch metrics and alarms

        Datadog / New Relic (optional)

    Logging

        ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

        Fluentd / Fluent Bit

        Structured logging practices

        Log aggregation in cloud (CloudWatch Logs, S3 retention)

âœ… PHASE 4: Advanced Topics & Tooling

    Advanced CI/CD

        Canary deployments

        Blue/green deployment

        Feature toggles

        Secrets management in pipelines (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

    Security (DevSecOps)

        AWS security best practices

        Image scanning (Trivy, Aqua)

        IAM least privilege enforcement

        Network segmentation

        Secrets management

    SRE & Reliability

        SLAs, SLOs, SLIs

        Incident management and postmortems

        Chaos engineering basics

âœ… PHASE 5: Soft Skills & System Design

    System Design for DevOps

        Design a scalable, highly available web app infra on AWS

        CI/CD pipeline design

        Disaster recovery & backup strategies

        Caching (Redis, CDN like CloudFront)

    Collaboration Tools & Documentation

        JIRA, Confluence

        Writing runbooks

        Clear logging, tagging practices

âœ… Optional (Depending on Role)

    Serverless & Event-driven Architectures

        AWS Lambda, API Gateway

        SQS, SNS, EventBridge

    Python or Go for Automation

        Python scripting for AWS automation

        Boto3 or AWS SDKs

ðŸ“š Bonus: Projects to Build for Practice

    CI/CD pipeline deploying to EC2 and S3 (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)

    Kubernetes cluster with monitored microservices

    Terraform project with complete AWS infra (VPC, EC2, RDS, ALB)

    ELK Stack setup with logs from Docker containers

    Helm chart for a sample app with Ingress and Secrets
